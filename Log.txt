Update 29-08-2018 19h33
 - updated file 'ufpbots_transmissor4.ino'
  >changes:
    added a variable (int sent) to recieve return values of radio.write() for debug purposes;
    replaced loop for serial buffer (Serial.available()) for an ifcase due to issues related with it;
    radio.write() was duplicated to avoid issues with nRF halting transmission by lack of data in its buffer.
=============================================================================================================================
Update 30-08-2018 16h53
 - updated file 'ufpbots_transmissor4.ino'
  >changes:
    added missing "Serial.begin()" at setup branch on 'transmissor4' to properly use Serial functions;
    baud rate updated to 38400 on both algorithms to optimize usage of the RF module.
=============================================================================================================================
Update 03-09-2018 18h03
 - updated file 'config.h' over 'ufpbots_transmissor4.ino'
  >changes:
    updated values for CE and CSN definitions to correlate with the new transmitter hardware;
    commented MODE definition as it is still currently unused.
=============================================================================================================================
Update 04-09-2018 13h56
 - updated file 'ufpbots_transmissor4.ino'
  >changes:
    reduced payload size from standard (32 bytes) to 10 Bytes, in an attempt to reduce packet loss;
    forced tx buffer on transmitter to be emptied at every iteration expecting a reduction on data loss;
 - added new version for receiver in 'ufpbots_receptor2'
  >changes:
    now packets are read on an intermediary buffer, have their values checked and only then are transmitted;
    incorrect data is now less frequent, but latency is substancially higher;
    also reduced payload size to 10 Bytes for compatibility with 'ufpbots_transmissor4.ino'.
=============================================================================================================================
Update 21-09-2018 16h37
 - minor adjustment on 'ufpbots_receptor2.ino'
  >changes:
    corrected mismatching baud rate for serial comm, now 38400.
=============================================================================================================================
Update 24-09-2018 19h14
 - included 'ufpbots_swapper'
   >functionality:
     varies PWM from a pre-defined minimum to a pre-defined maximum alternating between all four logic states
     can be used to verify dead zones or to test communication responsiveness
