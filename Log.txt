Update 29-08-2018 19h33
 - updated file 'ufpbots_transmissor4.ino'
  >changes:
    added a variable (int sent) to recieve return values of radio.write() for debug purposes;
    replaced loop for serial buffer (Serial.available()) for an ifcase due to issues related with it;
    radio.write() was duplicated to avoid issues with nRF halting transmission by lack of data in its buffer.
